# EvolutionSimulator

# About the project
This program is an evolution simulator designed to replicate the processes of natural selection and species development over time. It features a dynamic environment where creatures face various challenges, inherit traits from their parents, and experience random mutations. As creatures adapt to their surroundings, their evolutionary history is tracked through a detailed ancestry tree.
